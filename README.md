<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew Abebe, and I am a software developer who is a detail oriented professional that continuously strives to learn new and exciting skills.

Although I began my studies in the social sciences, my curiosity opened a path for me to learn how to code. I realized that I was happy learning this new ability and gained employment as a Business Analyst where I performed SQL programming. Additionally, I carried out consulting projects for key clients.

I have gained experience as a software developer by becoming a member at LearningFuze. At LearningFuze I have developed critical thinking and problem solving skills while using tools and technologies including, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. My greatest accomplishment as a developer was completing two solo-projects which challenged me and allowed me to work on applications with subject matters that I am interested in, such as the stock market and personal finance. 
  
I am dedicated to improving my knowledge and understanding of software development and I look forward to elaborating on how my specific skills and abilities will benefit your organization.</p>
